## Resources for curation of intensive care dataset at Univeristy Hospitals Bristol. 

The main curation stages are detailed in the iPython notebook: dataset_curation.ipynb

Outputs have been removed from all scripts and the data required to run the iPython notebook cannot be shared publicly for reasons of data privacy. However, the documents are well commented and should be informative to follow.
