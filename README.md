## Resources for curation of intensive care dataset at Univeristy Hospitals Bristol. 

The main curation stages are detailed in the iPython notebook: dataset_curation.ipynb

Outputs have been removed from all scripts and the data required to run the iPython notebook cannot be shared publicly for reasons of data privacy. However, the documents are well commented and should be informative to follow. 

### See accompanying publication in F1000Research: "Curation of an intensive care research dataset from routinely collected patient data in an NHS trust."
  
The dataset described is used for clinical audit and service evaluation in-house. We invite external researchers to request access to the data via formal research ethics approval.
